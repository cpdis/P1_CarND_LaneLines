The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of the following 8 steps:

1. Convert the image to grayscale using the method described earlier in the lesson with the help of the helper function included in the notebook.
2. Apply Gaussian smoothing using the helper function.
3. Run Canny edge detection to detect edges and convert to high contrast image. It took a good bit of trial and error to determine the high and low thresholds but I think the values that I settled on do good job with the example images and video. With different images or video the tuning parameters would need to be changed to accomodate.
4. Calculate regions of interest for both sides of the image (left and right). The region_of_interest helper function was used and the left and right vertices were defined as arrays. The vertex arrays were based on the width and height of the image as well as an adjustment factor to change the size of the region. I think there is a tradeoff between the size (height) of the region of interest and the ability to detect curves.
5. Run a Hough transform on the edges in both (left and right) regions of interest. Followed the same steps that were used in the classroom video. The parameters probably aren't perfect but I think the output videos show that these parameters perform decently. Like I mentioned above, with different test images and video the parameters would need to be adjusted.
6. Slopes based on the output of the Hough transform were computed using another helper function that took advantage of the np.apply_along_axis() function. The [example documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.apply_along_axis.html) was very helpful. Once the slopes were calculated those that fell outside the specified range were removed.
7. The draw_lines helper function was modified to determine the best fit line for each region of interest. A linear_regression helper function was written to determine the characteristics of each best fit line. The linear_regression function was based heavily on the [documentation for np.linalg.lstsq().](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html) Upper and lower points within the image were determined then lines were drawn through those points and displayed.
8. Finally, the weighted_img() helper function was used to draw the lines on the image.

###2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

1. There are a bunch of tunable parameters used for this project. Based on what I know so far, it would be difficult to generalize this part of the pipeline and, therefore, the parameters would have to be changed based on the input video (or images). In addition, this pipeline will only work in daylight with no adverse weather conditions.

2. The regions of interest are fixed at this point in time which would break the pipeline if the orientation of the camera (image) were changed. I'm interested in learning out to account for this in the future.

3. The lines drawn on the video are very jittery during some portions of the road. In addition, I don't think that my pipeline, as it stands, would handle curved lines very well (if at all).

4. I could not get the Optional Challenge portion of the project to work. I think that I was on the right path but I kept failing to output the full video.

###3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

Basically, addressing the shortcomings described above. The pipeline should be able to accomodate all weather conditions as well as nighttime driving.
